: After inserting 47 (but before rebalancing), the tree will look like this:

# TODO
: \vspace{0.6in}

: At this point, the tree is out of balance at node ... so we rotate ...

# TODO: finish the above statement.
: \vspace{0.6in}

: The resulting tree looks like this:

# TODO: write the post-balance tree here.
: \vspace{0.6in}

: Is the tree now balanced?  If not, perform the next rotation here.  Repeat until the tree is balanced.
: \vspace{1in}
