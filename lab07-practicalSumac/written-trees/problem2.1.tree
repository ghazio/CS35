        9
    7       8
  6   5   7   2
 3 5 1

: The value 8 is initially added as follows:


        9
      7        8
  6    5     7   2
3  5  1 8

: We swap 8 with 5 as our first swap:
          9
      7        8
  6    8     7   2
3  5  1 5

: Now, we swap 7 with 8 as our first swap. :
          9
      8        8
  6    7     7   2
3  5  1 5

:We cannot swap 8 with 9 since 9 is larger than 8. Hence, our tree looks like:
          9
      8        8
  6    7     7   2
3  5  1 5
